  summary: |-
    I was an outsourced consultant programmer for various client companies and a maintainer of FDTE's open-source platform, specializing in Node.js, Rust, C#, and Python. I helped clients improve their development environments by migrating to new systems such as Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, internal library/framework distributions, versioning, documentation formalization, and using different cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Allowing them to increase development velocity, reduce errors, and improve their software delivery processes.
    In addition to enhancing clients' development environments, also, I helped improve their visibility into their business operations by leveraging Agile and Kanban methodologies, along with automation techniques, to establish a cohesive and efficient work environment, fostering greater collaboration among cross-functional teams, resulting in faster issue resolution, optimized communication, and streamlined workflows. 
    My contributions led to more productive and profitable organizations, and I am proud to have played a key role in their success.

  summary: |
    One of my contributions at FieldLink was working on the company's runtime/library for low code development. This library made it easy to create custom forms for multiple roles of employees, which could be used across multiple locations simultaneously, even in an offline-first approach.
    I also implemented testing and tracing, as well as their automation, for the mobile applications, significantly improved the development process, and ensured that the applications were high quality.
    My experience at FieldLink has honed my mobile development and infrastructure skills. While also fostering a passion for open-source software and community engagement. I am excited to bring these skills and experiences to my next role as a Software Engineer.
